        "\n",
        "ints:\n",
        "ints are whole numbers. e.g. 1234, -10, 20201278.\n",
        "Integers in Python have arbitrary precision -- the amount of digits is limited only by the available memory of the host system.\n",
        "\n",
        "floats:\n",
        "floats are numbers containing a decimal point. e.g. 0.0,3.14,-9.01.\n",
        "Floating point numbers are usually implemented in Python using a double in C (15 decimal places of precision), but will vary in representation based on the host system and other implementation details. This can create some surprises when working with floats, but is \"good enough\" for most situations.\n",

        "Your friend Chandler plans to visit exotic countries all around the world. Sadly, Chandler's math skills aren't good. He's pretty worried about being scammed by currency exchanges during his trip - and he wants you to make a currency calculator for him."
