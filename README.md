# Exercism_Python
Currently I'm passing daily tasks of python at exercism.com, so I add my tasks here for anyone to use. 
Instructions: 
An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.
